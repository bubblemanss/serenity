#Problems

1) Everyone has problems and some are embarrassing, making it hard for them to talk about their issues and get the necessary feedback that they need. 

A forum where users can sign up create forums for people to make posts about their issues and get the feedback they want/need while stay anonyomous.


2) Food banks constantly need cans and other foods. 

People go to the grocery store everyday, why not create and app that allows food banks to post whatever food they need for that weel (peanut butter, etc) and then people can access this information via an app when theyre shopping for food

Make an easy way for people to donate a specified amount of money everytime they go to the grocery store (at the POS system)


3) In Tanzania, there are very little physicians available for the public (1% per 10000 people)

Create a web app that can educate people with basic healthcare, instructional videos, lectures, etc.


4) lonely ass people with no one to hang out

A place solely meant for them to meet up and socialize with each other, not online, but in person.


5)POVERTY 

app allows people to donate food to other at ppl and stuff


6) Can't find parking

parking assistance 


7) anxiety issues 

safe space


8) Stuck with no where to go, rain or homeless
